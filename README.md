# Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for End-to-End Encrypted Chat Application

# 1. Introduction

**1.1 Purpose**

The purpose of this document is to provide a detailed overview of the requirements for the development of an end-to-end encrypted chat application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) with Chakra UI for user interface design.


**1.2 Scope**

The scope of this project includes developing a chat application using the MERN stack with Chakra UI, focusing on user registration, group creation, and robust encryption techniques.

# 2. System Overview

**2.1 System Description**

The system is a real-time chat application that allows users to securely communicate with each other using end-to-end encryption. It includes features such as user registration, group management, and secure messaging.

**2.2 System Features**

* Full logic signup functionality
* Creation and management of groups
* Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange (DH) for secure key generation
* AES encryption for message confidentiality

# 3. Functional Requirements


**3.1 User Management**

**3.1.1 User Registration**
